# discordEmoji

Short script that generates large blocks of text. Used in Discord chats. Not responsible for getting you banned.

# Usage

For reference, please see the files located in the `sample_data` directory.

Here are some steps to get you up and running.

- Clone this repository :tm:
- Create a new `virtualenv` by using `python3 -m venv venv`
- Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements
# V1 Setup

`V1` doesn't have too much functionality, and was more built as a test. However, here's how to use it:

- `cd` to the `discordEmoji` directory
  - Run `./src/v1/main.py` and follow the prompts.

# V2 Setup

`V2` is the go-to for `discordEmoji` usage at this point. I should honestly jut deprecate `v1`, but you never know.
- `cd` to the `discordEmoji` directory
- Run `./src/v2/emoji.py` and follow the prompts.
- As an added feature, `emoji.py` will open the output in a web browser.  
  If you don't want that, just say so when prompted.
- This script is just about as simple as `v1`, but it looks a lot cooler :)
